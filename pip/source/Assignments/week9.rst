Reading Response 8
------------------

Why is the GPL described as `viral`? Do you think it gives programmers more or less "freedom" to do what they want with software than the BSD-style license does?
  
.. actex:: rr_8_1

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes

   """

The chapter describes the idea of pipes as an important breakthrough. To get a clearer idea of what is meant by that, learn a little about how to use pipes in the bash shell, by following `this tutorial <http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-pipes-filters.htm>`_. Then jot down your thoughts about why pipes was a breakthrough. What did it enable in the development of unix?

What's the URL for one of the photos that opened in your browser when you ran session19.py?

   print url

Write code to pick out the "owner" of the third photo retrieved in the flickrdemo function. (It's OK to modify the flicrdemo function to do that. Test your code by running it at your command prompt and paste the relevant line or lines of code here.)
