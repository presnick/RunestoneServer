**Due:** **Friday, January 31, 5 pm**

**Instructions:** Write the code you want to save in the provided boxes, and click **save** for each one. 
The last code you have saved for each one by the deadline is what will be graded.


1. (6 points) Old McDonald had a farm. He records the animals on his farm in a dictionary called 'animals'. 
In this problem help Old McDonald manage his farm animals. Be sure to answer all six parts, a-f.

   .. actex:: ps_3_1

      animals = {
         'cows': 2,
         'chickens': 8,
         'pigs': 4,
         'mice': 72,
         'cats': 9,
         'dogs': 1,
      }

      # a. Print the number of chickens in the farm (by having your code look it up
      # in the animals dictionary. "Print(8)" is cheating...)
      
      # b. Old McDonald was given a yak. Add a yak to to the animals dictionary.

      # c. Old McDonald foud a stray dog. Increase the number of dogs on the farm by 1.

      # d. print out the names and quantities of all animals on his farm, one per line, in any order.
      # For example:
      # 2 cows
      # 9 cats
      # ...

      # e. While giving tours of his farm to children, they often inquire about particular
      # animals. Write code that asks the user to input an animal name, and then
      # prints out how many of that animal he has; or 0 if he has none.
      # For example, output "8 chickens" or "0 elephants"

      # f. Write a statement that tells Old McDonald which animal he has the most of.
      # This statement should print "72 mice", given the current state of the
      # dictionary, but your code should work correctly even if mice aren't the
      # most numerous animal on his farm.

For the next three exercises, you will analyze data from our group on Facebook. To 'load' the data you will need to copy and paste it into the python prompt, in between the quotation marks. To maintain confidentiality (i.e., only students in 106 can see it), the data lives in a `file on cTools. <https://ctools.umich.edu/access/content/group/80ba0083-6409-4149-8222-f210f9dc6dd1/Problem%20Sets/PS3/simplefbdata.txt>`_

#. (2 points) For each post or comment in the facebook group, print out the name of the poster.

   .. actex:: ps_3_2

      fb = """
      # Delete this line and paste file contents here
      """

      x = fb.split("\n")
      # x now refers to a list, with each line of text as one element in the list.
      # If you're not sure, trying printing x, len(x), x[1], and x[1][0] and make sure you understand
      # why you get the output you do

      # Your output should look something like:
      # Paul R.
      # Jackie C.
      # Jackie C.
      # Nick R.
      # Jackie C.

#. (2 points) Use the Facebook data to count the number of posts (or reply comments) each person made in the Facebook group.

   .. actex:: ps_3_3

      fb = """
      # Delete this line and paste file contents here
      """

      x = fb.split("\n")

      # Your output should look something like this, but with different numbers:
      # Paul R. posted 1 times  (# or, if you're ambitious, make it say 1 time instead of 1 times)
      # Jackie C. posted 3 times
      # Nick R. posted 2 times

#. (optional: 1 bonus point; this one is much harder)  Use the Facebook data to determine who made the longest post or comment (most characters); print out the poster's name and the contents.

Problem Set
-----------

.. datafile::  about_programming.txt
   :hide:

   Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an
   original formulation of a computing problem to executable programs. It involves
   activities such as analysis, understanding, and generically solving such problems
   resulting in an algorithm, verification of requirements of the algorithm including its
   correctness and its resource consumption, implementation (or coding) of the algorithm in
   a target programming language, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code,
   implementation of the build system and management of derived artefacts such as machine
   code of computer programs. The algorithm is often only represented in human-parseable
   form and reasoned about using logic. Source code is written in one or more programming
   languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, Smalltalk, JavaScript, etc.). The purpose of
   programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a
   specific task or solve a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires
   expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
   specialized algorithms and formal logic.
   Within software engineering, programming (the implementation) is regarded as one phase in a software development process. There is an on-going debate on the extent to which
   the writing of programs is an art form, a craft, or an engineering discipline. In
   general, good programming is considered to be the measured application of all three,
   with the goal of producing an efficient and evolvable software solution (the criteria
   for "efficient" and "evolvable" vary considerably). The discipline differs from many
   other technical professions in that programmers, in general, do not need to be licensed
   or pass any standardized (or governmentally regulated) certification tests in order to
   call themselves "programmers" or even "software engineers." Because the discipline
   covers many areas, which may or may not include critical applications, it is debatable
   whether licensing is required for the profession as a whole. In most cases, the
   discipline is self-governed by the entities which require the programming, and sometimes
   very strict environments are defined (e.g. United States Air Force use of AdaCore and
   security clearance). However, representing oneself as a "professional software engineer"
   without a license from an accredited institution is illegal in many parts of the world.
 


**Due:** **Friday, January 24, 5 pm**

**Instructions:** Write the code you want to save in the provided boxes, and click **save** for each one. The last code you have saved for each one by the deadline is what will be graded.

1. (2 points) Print out each element of list ``lbc`` on a separate line. Then print the first character of each element on a separate line.

   .. actex:: ps_2_1
   
      lbc = ["one","four","two","six","nine","eleven"]
      
      # write code to print each element of list lbc on a separate line
      
      # write code to print the first character of each element of list lbc on a separate line

      rv = """Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  
         Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,

      # (For these questions, imagine that you couldn't see the whole string value, 
      # but you still needed to answer them.)
      
      # Write code to find out whether the word "raven" is in the string rv. 
      # Print "Yes" if it is, and "No" if it isn't.
      
      # Write code to find out whether the word "rapping" is in the string rv. 
      # Print "Yes" if it is, and "No" if it isn't.



The remaining questions in the problem set deal with a file called ``about_programming.txt`` 
that you can access in an ActiveCode window using the open() function. 
It is made up of text from the *Computer Programming* article on Wikipedia; ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming``.

#. (1 point) Write code to open the file, about_programming.txt, and print it out, line by line.

   .. actex:: ps_2_4

      # Don't worry about extra blank lines between each of the lines
      # (but if you want to get rid of them, try the .strip method)


#. (2 points) Print the number of lines in the file

   .. actex:: ps_2_5


#. (2 points) Print the number of lines in the file that include the word "program" or any extension of it (program, programs, programming, programmer).

   .. actex:: ps_2_6

#. *1 BONUS POINT* (not required): Write code to find, and print, the number of vowels in the file.

   .. actex:: ps_2_7

      # Write your code here, if you choose to try this problem!
