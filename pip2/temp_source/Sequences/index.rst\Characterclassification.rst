Character classification
------------------------

It is often helpful to examine a character and test whether it is upper- or
lowercase, or whether it is a character or a digit. The ``string`` module
provides several constants that are useful for these purposes. One of these,
``string.digits`` is equivalent to "0123456789".  It can be used to check if a character
is a digit using the ``in`` operator.

The string ``string.ascii_lowercase`` contains all of the ascii letters that the system
considers to be lowercase. Similarly, ``string.ascii_uppercase`` contains all of the
uppercase letters. ``string.punctuation`` comprises all the characters considered
to be punctuation. You can't actually run the code below in the browser (sorry, limitation of our environment, not
*all* of python has been implemented.) But the comments indicate what would be produced; later in the
semester you'll have facilities for actually executing it.

.. activecode:: seq_char_classification
    
    print(string.ascii_lowercase)
    print(string.ascii_uppercase)
    print(string.digits)
    print(string.punctuation)
    x = "a"
    y = "A"
    print(x in string.ascii_lowercase)  # True
    print(x in string.ascii_uppercase)  # False
    print(y in string.ascii_lowercase)  # False
    print(y in string.ascii_uppercase)  # True


For more information consult the ``string`` module documentation (see `Global Module Index <http://docs.python.org/py3k/py-modindex.html>`_).

Lists
=====

A **list** is a sequential collection of Python data values, where each value is identified by an
index. The values that make up a list are called its **elements**. Lists are
similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the
elements of a list can have any type and for any one list, the items can be of different types.
