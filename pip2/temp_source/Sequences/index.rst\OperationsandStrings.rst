Operations and Strings
----------------------

Python provides many built-in computations that you can perform on strings. There
are three different ways of invoking computations on objects. In addition to
operators (like ``+`` and ``*``), there are method invocations and function invocations. You 
will first learn some specific examples. Later in the course, you will understand
all the details of the differences.
