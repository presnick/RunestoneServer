Review Problems (Ungraded)
--------------------------

Below are some problems that will help you review the first several concepts we've gone over this semester. 
These probems are *OPTIONAL*, but if you struggled with PS2, we strongly recommend that you
work on these before you attempt PS3. If you are struggling with them, please come to office hours and discuss!
By the time you've done a few of these, the last few should start to come pretty easily.  
(We will release solutions on Thursday night.)

1. See comments in code for instructions.

   .. actex:: rv_1_1

      s = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
      # How many characters are in string s? Write code to print the answer.

      lp = ["hello","arachnophobia","lamplighter","inspirations","ice","amalgamation","programming","Python"]
      # How many characters are in each element of list lp? 
      # Write code to print the length (number of characters) of each element of the list on a separate line. 
      ## Do NOT write 8+ lines of code to do this.

      # The output you get should be:
      # 5
      # 13
      # 11
      # 12
      # 3
      # 12
      # 11

   .. actex:: rv_1_2

      ic = 93252759253293024
      # What is the value if you add 5 to the integer in ic?

      dcm = [9, 4, 67, 89, 98324, 23, 34, 67, 89, 34, 56, 67, 90, 3242, 9893, 5]
      # add 14 to each element of the list dcm and print the result

      # The output you get should be:
      # 23
      # 18
      # 81
      # 103
      # 98338

      # Print the last character of each element in the list on a separate line.
      # HINT: You should NOT have to count the length of any of these strings manually/by yourself.

      # Your output should be:

   .. actex:: rv_1_4

      bz = "elementary, my dear watson"
      # Write code to print the fifth character of string bz.
      # Your output should be:
      # e

      # Write code to print the seventh character of string bz.
      # Your output should be:

   .. actex:: rv_1_5

      nm = "Irene"
      # write code to print out the string "Why hello, Irene" using the variable nm.


      hlt = ['mycroft','Lestrade','gregson','sherlock','Joan','john','holmes','mrs hudson']
      # Write code to print "Nice to meet you," in front of each element in list hlt on a separate line.

      # Your output should look like:
      # Nice to meet you, mycroft
      # Nice to meet you, Lestrade
      # Nice to meet you, gregson
      # Nice to meet you, sherlock
      # Nice to meet you, Joan

   .. actex:: rv_1_6

      z = True
      # Write code to print the type of the value in the variable z.

      ab = 45.6
      # Write code to print the type of the value in the variable ab.

   .. actex:: rv_1_7

      fancy_tomatoes = ["hello", 6, 4.24, 8, 20, "newspaper", True, "goodbye", "False", False, 5967834, "6578.31"]

      # Write code to print the length of the list fancy_tomatoes.


      # Write code to print out each element of the list fancy_tomatoes on a separate line.
      # (You can do this in just 2 lines of code!)

      # Your output should look like:
      # hello
      # 6
      # 4.24
      # 8
      # 20
      # newspaper
      # True
      # goodbye
      # False
      # False
      # 5967834
      # 6578.31


      # Now write code to print out the type of each element of the list fancy_tomatoes on a separate line.

      # Your output should look like:
      # <type 'str'>
      # <type 'int'>
      # <type 'float'>
      # <type 'int'>
      # <type 'int'>
