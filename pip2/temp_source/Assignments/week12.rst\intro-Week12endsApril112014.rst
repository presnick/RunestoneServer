Introduction: Week 12: ends April 11, 2014
============================

For this week you have the following graded activities:

1. Prepare for classes

   * Before Tuesday's class:  
      * :ref:`Planning for your final project (below) <session24>`
      * Take a look at the code in inclass/craiglist.py; Nick will walk you through it during class but getting oriented in advance will help a lot.
      * (optional) Read about `Regular expresionsions <https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#regex-howto>`_. We did not use regular expressions in the Craiglist scraper, but it would have made life easier. Check them out if you're curious. (Regular expressions will **not** be on the final exam.)       

   * Before Thursday's class:
      * Answer the questions :ref:`below <session25>` to fill in the madlib about a Class you will define for your final project
      * Read about :ref:`sorting lists of class instances <sort_instances_chap>`
      * Try the exercises in session25.py
 
#. Turn in the reading response, by 8 PM the night before your registered section meets.

   * Read *The Success of Open Source*, Chapter 5
   * :ref:`Reading response 11 <response_11>`

#. Do Problem Set 11:
