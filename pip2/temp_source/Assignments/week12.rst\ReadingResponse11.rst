At an aggregate level, rather than an individual level, Weber argues that because open source projects are "antirival" goods, they can survive having only a small fraction of the participants making positive contributions. First, define "antiviral" in your own words. Then say whether you think the same argument would work just as well for a "nonrival" good as for an "antirival" good.
