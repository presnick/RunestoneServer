Session 24 prep
---------------

Planning your final project. Think of the questions below as a worksheet that steps you through the process of defining a final project. Do your best to answer them. I'll be looking at your answers in advance of Tuesday's class and will use some of them as examples to discuss as a class. Don't worry: you are not committed to any project ideas that you write about below. You are free to change your mind after you hear the discussion in class Tuesday (or even later).

If you are planning to improve the Shannon guesser, what are some of your ideas for reducing the number of guesses that will be required?

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes

   print s
   
If you are planning to **use** the Shannon guesser, what texts to you plan to apply it to, and why do you think it will be interesting to compare the guessability scores of those texts?

.. actex:: session24_2

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes
   s = """

   """
   print s

If you are going to do some analysis of one or more data sources from the Internet, please answer the next two questions.

First what data source(s) will you use and what documentation have you found on how to access it (them)? Please include URLs to the documentation you've found.

.. actex:: session24_3

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes
   s = """

   """
   print s

Second, what analysis do you plan to do on the data that you get?

.. actex:: session24_4

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes
   s = """

   """
   print s

For everyone, how do you plan to present the results of your analysis/computations? If you will just be generating text to display on the screen, provide a fictitious sample output that your program might generate. If you will be generating data to upload into Excel, describe what the rows of the Excel table will include and what kind of chart you will make. 

.. actex:: session24_5

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes
   s = """

   print s
