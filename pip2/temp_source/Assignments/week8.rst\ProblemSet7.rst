Problem Set 7
-------------

All of the problem set instructions for this week are in the code file ps7/ps7.py.

At your terminal window, cd to your code directory, then enter the following comands:

* ``git status`` If your working directory is not "clean", make sure to save and commit all your work. 

* ``git pull upstream master`` to get the latest code from us.

* ``cd ps7``. That will connect you to the subdirectory ps7

* ``ls``. You should see ps7.py, test.py, train.txt, and test.txt

* In your text editor, edit ps7.py, which contains instructions on what changes you are supposed to make. In your command prompt, run the code file by typing ``python ps7.py``

* Don't forget to finish the workflow by committing your work and pushing it to bitbucket. See :ref:`Git workflow <git_workflow>`
