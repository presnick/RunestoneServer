Take a look at the `linux project on github <https://github.com/torvalds/linux>`_, a site that's very similar to bitbucket but with a slightly different user interface. Take a look at the recent commits. Click around to see how many people have made contributions recently. Also check out the github page for `Runestone <https://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone>`_ and for `my fork of it <https://github.com/presnick/runestone>`_ to make this online textbook. Report on something interesting you found from exploring these public git repositories.
