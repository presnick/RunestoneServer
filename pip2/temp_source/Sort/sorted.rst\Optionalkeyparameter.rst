Optional key parameter
----------------------

If you want to sort things in some order other than the "natural" or or its reverse,
you can provide an additional parameter, the key parameter. For example, suppose
you want to sort a list of numbers based on their absolute value, so that -4 comes after 3?
Or suppose you have a dictionary with strings as the keys and numbers as the values. Instead
of sorting them in alphabetic order based on the keys, you might like to sort them in
order based on their values.

First, let's see an example, and then we'll dive into how it works.

First, let's define a function absolute that takes a number and returns its
absolute value. (Actually, python provides a built-in function ``abs`` that does
this, but we are going to define our own, for reasons that will be explained
in a minute.)

.. activecode:: sort_4

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]

    def absolute(x):
        if x >= 0:
            return x
        else:
            return -x
            
    print(absolute(3))
    print(absolute(-119))
    
    for y in L1:
        print(absolute(y))
        

Now, we can pass the absolute function to L1 in order to specify that we want
the items sorted in order of their absolute value, rather than in order of 
their actual value.

.. activecode:: sort_5

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]
     
    def absolute(x):
        if x >= 0:
            return x
        else:
            return -x
            
    L2 = sorted(L1, None, absolute)
    print(L2)
    
    #or in reverse order
    print(sorted(L1, None, absolute, True)) 
     
What's really going on there? We've done something pretty strange. Before, all the
values we have passed as parameters have been pretty easy to understand: numbers, strings,
lists, Booleans, dictionaries. Here we have passed a function object: absolute
is a variable name whose value is the function. When we pass that function object,
it is *not* automatically invoked. Instead, it is just bound the formal parameter
key of the function sorted.

We are not going to look at the source code for the built-in function sorted. But if
we did, we would find somewhere in its code a reference to the variable key, whose
value would be bound to the function we passed in. In fact, what the sorted function
does is call that key function once for each item in the list that's getting sorted.
It associates the result returned by that function (the absolute function in our case)
with the original value. Think of those associated values as being little post-it notes
that decorate the original values. The value 4 has a post-it note that says 4 on it,
but the value -2 has a post-it note that says 2 on it. Then the sorted function
rearranges the original items in order of the values written on their associated post-it notes.

To illustrate that the absolute function is invoked once on each item, during the execution
of sorted, I have added some print statements into the code.

.. activecode:: sort_6

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]
     
    def absolute(x):
        print("--- figuring out what to write on the post-it note for " + str(x)) 
        if x >= 0:
            return x
        else:
            return -x
    
    print("About to call sorted")
    L2 = sorted(L1, None, absolute)
    print("Finished execution of sorted")
    print(L2)

Note that this code never explicitly calls the absolute function at all. It passes
the absolute function as a parameter value to the sorted function. Inside the 
sorted function, whose code we haven't seen, that function gets invoked.
