Important Concepts
------------------

Up till now, we have written code in the active code windows and clicked "Run" to run it. You saw results in the console, below the active code windows-- remember, ``print`` is for people.

When you write code and run it *on your own computer*, what happens is basically this:

You'll write a program and save it as a file. You need a text editor to do this (more about this below! Note that MS Word is *not* a text editor). 

.. note::

   All programs you will write from here on will be stored in files (or groups of files, but we'll get to that) that are saved in a certain way so the computer knows these are *Python programs*. 

You will have an interpreter for Python programs installed on your computer. Read on to find out how to do that. Naturally enough, that interpreter will be called ``python``.

You'll use an interface we call the **command line**, or **command prompt**, to essentially say "hey, python, find this file that has my Python program, and interpret and then run it."  The analog of clicking on the "Run" button in our online environment will be to type ``python <your_code_file_name.py>`` at a command prompt. For example:

You'll always have to know exactly where you saved your code file on your computer. (Also more on this below.) Similar to how every single character matters when you write Python code, you have to tell the computer exactly where the program file you want to run is. 

In summary, the biggest differences from the online environment you've been using will be that you'll switch back and forth between two windows (one for editing the code, another for running it), you will name all the code files you save, and it's very important how and where you save your files.
