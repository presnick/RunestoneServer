Install and configure a text editor
-----------------------------------

You will need a text editor. There are many options for this. For example, serious
programmers often use Eclipse or XCode. But we do not recommend those for beginniners. There's a lot stuff to configure that you don't need right now. (Many serious programmers don't use those either!) Definitely **do not** use MS Word. Word will not save files in the right format: it
doesn't save documents as plain text, which is necessary to write and run programs, and it doesn't do any syntax highlighting or
other useful things. 

The editor that we will help you to use is called **TextWrangler**. (TextWrangler and Notepad++ are very similar, but one runs on Macs and one runs on Windows.) Please download it from
`the TextWrangler site <http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/download.html>`_. Download it and then run the installer to install TextWrangler, like you would most programs you download.

TextWrangler may ask you to register for something. You can hit Cancel -- you do not need to register for anything to use TextWrangler, and it will not expire.

Follow the instructions below. It should be 
quite intuitive. Keep in mind the concepts from earlier -- TextWrangler is an environment (a piece of software)
for _creating_ python programs. It's not intended (in this course) for running them!

Start TextWrangler from a Dock shortcut icon, finding it in your Applications folder, or startinit from Spotlight. Enter your first Python program into NotePad++:

Save your program as ``firstprog.py``. You can save it anywhere. In a little while we'll
create a code folder in a convenient place on your machine and you can resave the file then. 
You will notice that after you save the file, TextWrangler will color your code based on the Python syntax rules. That's because you saved it with the ``.py`` file extension, which tells the computer this file is a Python program.

Syntax coloring is a very helpful feature, as it gives you visual feedback about your program and can help you track down syntax errors more easily. 
TextWrangler only knows that your file is a Python file after you save it with a ".py" suffix, or file extension.
