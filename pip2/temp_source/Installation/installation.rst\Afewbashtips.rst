A few bash tips
---------------

Here are a few tips that make it easier to work with the bash command prompt.

#. If you hit the up-arrow key or ctrl-P, it retrieves the previous command that you entered. Do it repeatedly to get to earlier commands in your history. Once you find a command you like, hit Enter to execute it again, or you can edit it.

#. While entering a command, in many situations you can hit Tab to auto-complete the thing that you were typing. For example, if you start typing ``python fir`` and then hit tab, it will auto-complete it for you.

#. Close the git bash window by typing ``exit``. This is the best way to close it because it will remember your past commands in the history when you restart the program.
