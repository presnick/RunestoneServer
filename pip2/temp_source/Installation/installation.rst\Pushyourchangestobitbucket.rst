Push your changes to bitbucket
------------------------------

Whenever you make a commit, we recommend that you push the code repository back to bitbucket. You **have** to do that to turn in your problem sets. And it's a good idea to do it more often as a way of backing up your code to a remote server.

1. Type ``git push origin master``  (Origin means send it back to the original location where you got it from, at bitbucket. master means to send the "master" branch. We are not teaching you about branches in this gentle introduction to git, so don't worry about that: you will always be working with the master branch.)

2. Check on bitbucket by visiting the page for your repository and clicking on "Source". You can see that your code files have now made it to their servers. You can even click on the individual code files to see their contents.
