Install and configure python
----------------------------

Because you have a mac, you're lucky in this case (though you can develop fine on any operating system) -- you already have Python! It comes pre-installed. However, we need to make sure you have the correct version of Python. We will be using version **2.7.**

If you have Mac OS 10.7 (Lion) or later, you definitely have Python 2.7. If you have Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or earlier, you may have a different version of Python. If so, let's get this straightened out early -- come see one of the instructors. (If this applies to many people, we will provide additional instructions for that installation!)

To find out what version of Python you have, you'll first need to open a program on your mac called the **Terminal**. You can find it via Spotlight, or in your Applications folder. The icon looks like this:

.. image:: Figures/terminalicon.png

When you open it, you'll see a window that should look something like this:

.. image:: Figures/emptyterminal.png

Except the name of *your* computer will be there. (That'll be whatever you called your hard drive -- probably your name, if you've chosen to keep the default!)

Terminal is the way you use your **command line**. That blinking cursor when you first open the window -- when you type there, we might say you're typing at the command prompt. Before we talk about how you use this, you're going to use a command that will tell us what version of python you have installed on your mac.

Type: ``python -V``, and press return. That process should look something like this:

.. image:: Figures/typedpython.png
        :width: 300px

.. image:: Figures/returntypedpython.png
        :width: 300px

If you see a 2.7 (and the third number can be anything) on the screen, like in that image above, you're fine. If you get an error, please see one of the instructors!

You're now all ready to run Python. We'll run that program you just wrote in TextWrangler shortly, in the next section!
