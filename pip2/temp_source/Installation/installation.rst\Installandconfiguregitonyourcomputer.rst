Install and configure git on your computer
------------------------------------------

git is a tool for working with other people on writing code and other documents. 
It's really valuable to know
how to use it, because it will let you start working easily with other people 
you haven't worked with before, at hackathons, for example. We will be learning
the very basics of git in this course, and using it to distribute code and problem sets and for you to turn in 
your problem sets.

The way you'll be using git is the same as for people who use Windows. But easier to set up. 

Download the latest version of git for mac from [this site](http://git-scm.com/downloads). It is a **.dmg** file, like most software you download to install on a mac. Double click on it and install it the way you normally would any program. It will not create an icon or anything you can see.
