Configure git with your name and email address
----------------------------------------------

.. note:: 

   **This was added after class Tuesday to correct problems people were having with later steps.** 
   
Now, you need to set up git with your identity so it knows who you are when you go to pull stuff from, or push stuff to, a repository, and will allow you to do it easily.   
At your command prompt, type:

``` git config --global user.name "Your Name Goes Here" ```

hit enter/return, and then type, at the command prompt,

``` git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com" ```

The email you put in here should be the same email you use to sign up for a Bitbucket account (that comes later in the instructions).

That should look like this, except with your name (whatever you want it to be) and your email (very important):

Great. **If you continue to have problems after these adapted instructions, let the instructional team know.**
