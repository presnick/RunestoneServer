Install Apple Command Line Tools
--------------------------------

.. note::

   **This was added after class Tuesday. It should fix many of your problems.** 

You also need to download the Apple Command Line Tools, because these contain some things that make git work 'behind the scenes'. To do this, go to this url: ``` https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action ```.

It will direct you to a login page. If you do not have an Apple developer ID, you'll need to register one. (It just allows you to download free things like this stuff we're getting now, that will help you create and develop applications.) If you do, you can log in.

You should then see a big list of things you can download, like this:

You want to download the Command Line Tools for your operating system.

If you have 10.9 (Mavericks), download the Command Line Tools for Mavericks.
If you have 10.8 (Mountain Lion), download the Command Line Tools for Mountain Lion.
If you have 10.7 (Lion), download the Command Line Tools for Lion. (These may be further down the list -- you can search for Lion in the search box, or keep scrolling through the pages till you find it.)

*If you have 10.6 (Snow Leopard)*, download the **Command Line Tools - Late March 2012**. (We know, this is a bit unclear.) Unfortunately, you'll have to do a little more work. We'd like to actually do this with you to make sure it works OK and avoid frustration, since we haven't been able to test it yet. Bring your computer to discussion, office hours, or set up a time to do this quickly with either Nick or Jackie (Prof. Resnick has a Windows machine and is pretty useless on a Mac). If this gets unsustainable, again, we'll release more instructions for that process.

**If you have completed these updated instructions and are still having problems, contact an instructor.**

.. _git_repos:

Fork and clone the git repository for code samples and exercises
================================================================

Finally, you will need to get set up for downloading code for in-class exercises and for problem sets, and for uploading your problem sets for grading.
