Customize the git bash display a little
---------------------------------------

There are a couple more configuration changes that I highly recommend. You don't absolutely have
to do these, but they're very useful. Most importantly, they will allow you to cut
and paste in the git bash window.

#. Close the git bash window if you haven't already.

#. In the Windows menu, right click on git bash and choose "Run as Administrator". This will allow you to change some of the configurations.

#. Right click on the icon in the upper left of the git bash window and choose properties.

#. Check the box for Quick Edit Mode. That will let you copy and paste text in the window.

#. Change the buffer size to 999. That way it will remember 999 commands in your history.

#. Under the Layout Tab, you may want to make a wider width. I've chosen 120 characters. I also chose a bigger font size for myself, but you may be fine with default font.

#. Click OK.
