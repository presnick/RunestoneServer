Introduction: Preparing for the Rest of the Course
====================================

It has been convenient to be able to execute python code right in the browser. To write and
execute bigger programs, to use modules beyond the few (like the ``random`` module) that have been implemented for this
environment , and to perform file and network operations, you will need to
run Python *natively* on your computer.

First, we'll provide an overview of how writing and running programs on your own computer works. Then we'll provide instructions for installing what you need and getting the new setup going. 

There are different instructions for Windows users and Mac users below. (If you use Linux, there are no instructions for you -- we assume in that case you know what you are doing here, but if you are confused, let us know.)

None of the steps below is particularly difficult, but there are a lot of them, and if you inadvertently skip one, you're going to have a bad time. I recommend that you print out this chapter and use a pen to check off the steps as you do them, or do the equivalent on screen with a PDF file.
