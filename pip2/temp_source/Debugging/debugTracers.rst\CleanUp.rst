Clean Up
--------

When you are done with outlining and testing your program, delete any diagnostic print statements from your program. No one really needs to see the test statements you wrote, and leaving test statements in the program might confuse you if you add more to the program.

Extra comments do help other people read your code, but try to leave in only the bits that you think are useful. There is an art to writing good informative comments, and you can only learn this art by reading other people's programs and having your peers read your programs. As a rule of thumb for comments, when in doubt, keep it; it you’re worried it won’t make sense to you or someone else later, add more detail to it.

Understanding Code
==================

Whether you’re trying to understand a code snippet that someone else wrote or trying to understand your own code that isn’t doing exactly what you wanted, you can avoid a lot of frustration if you slow down and spend the time to fully understand that code. It will reduce your anxiety level as well and make programming more fun!

The basic strategy for understanding code is the "explain; predict; check" loop.
