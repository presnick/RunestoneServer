Sketch an Outline
-----------------

We are suggesting you first write down all the steps you want the program to do. You can do this in any manner you like. We are going to show you how to outline using comments, but if you are more visual you might want to sketch on a piece of paper and if you are more spatial try walking around the room. The big trick is to understand everything you want to do first in your own words, so then you are translating them to the computer.
