Predict
-------

In the predict phase, you will predict the effect of running a snippet of code. Later on in your development, you may make predictions about large snippets of code, but for now you will typically be predicting the effect of executing a single line of code, or at most the net effect of running an entire ``for`` loop. A prediction will either be about what gets printed out, or about the value of a variable, or that an error will occur.

A prediction is not a random guess. It is based on some explanation you have about what the current state of variables is and about what you think certain commands in python do.
