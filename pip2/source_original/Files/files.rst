Working with Data Files
=======================

So far, the data we have used in this book have all been either coded right into the program, or have been entered by the user.  
In real life data reside in files.  For example the images we worked with in the image processing unit ultimately live in files on your hard drive.  
Web pages, and word processing documents, and music are other examples of data that live in files.  In this short chapter we will introduce the Python concepts necessary to use data from files in our programs.

For our purposes, we will assume that our data files are text files--that is, files filled with characters. 
The Python programs that you write are stored as text files.  We can create these files in any of a number of ways. 
For example, we could use a text editor to type in and save the data.  We could also download the data from a website and then save it in a file. 
Regardless of how the file is created, Python will allow us to manipulate the contents.

In Python, we must **open** files before we can use them and **close** them when we are done with them. As you might expect, once a file is opened it becomes a Python object just like all other data. 
:ref:`Table 1<filemethods1a>` shows the functions and methods that can be used to open and close files.

.. _filemethods1a:

================ ======================== =====================================================
**Method Name**   **Use**                  **Explanation**
================ ======================== =====================================================
``open``          ``open(filename,'r')``    Open a file called filename and use it for reading.  This will return a reference to a file object.
``open``          ``open(filename,'w')``    Open a file called filename and use it for writing.  This will also return a reference to a file object.
``close``        ``filevariable.close()``   File use is complete.
================ ======================== =====================================================

Finding a File on your Disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opening a file requires that you, as a programmer, and Python agree about the location of the file on your disk.  
The way that files are located on disk is by their **path**  You can think of the filename as the short name for a file, and the path as the full name.  
For example on a Mac if you save the file ``hello.txt`` in your home directory the path to that file is ``/Users/yourname/hello.txt``  
On a Windows machine the path looks a bit different but the same principles are in use.  For example on windows the path might be ``C:\Users\yourname\My Documents\hello.txt``

You can access files in folders, also called directories, under your home directory by adding a slash and the name of the folder.  
For example, if you had a file called ``hello.py`` in a folder called ``SI106``  that was inside a folder called ``PyCharmProjects`` under your home directory, 
then the full name for ``hello.py`` stored in the CS150 folder would be ``/Users/yourname/PyCharmProjects/SI106/hello.py``

Here's the important rule to remember:  If your file and your Python program are in the same directory you can simply use the filename. ``open('myfile.txt','r')`` 
If your file and your Python program are in different directories then you should use the path to the file ``open(/Users/joebob01/myfile.txt)``.

.. note::

   For security reasons, our code running in your browser doesn't read or write files to your computer's file system. Later in the semester, when you run python
   natively on your own computer, you will be able to truly read files, using path names as suggested above. To get you started, we have faked it by providing
   a few files that you can read *as if* they were on your hard disk. In this chapter, we simulate the existence of a textfile called ``qbdata.txt``. You can't
   open any other files from your local computer from code running this chapter.

Reading a File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an example, suppose we have a text file called ``qbdata.txt`` that contains
the following data representing statistics about NFL quarterbacks. Although it
would be possible to consider entering this data by hand each time it is used,
you can imagine that it would be time-consuming and error-prone to do this. In
addition, it is likely that there could be data from more quarterbacks and
other years. The format of the data file is as follows

::

    First Name, Last Name, Position, Team, Completions, Attempts, Yards, TDs Ints, Comp%, Rating

To open this file, we would call the ``open`` function. The variable,
``fileref``, now holds a reference to the file object returned by
``open``. When we are finished with the file, we can close it by using
the ``close`` method. After the file is closed any further attempts to
use ``fileref`` will result in an error.

::

   fileref = open("qbdata.txt","r")
   ## other code here that refers to variable fileref
   fileref.close()


Iterating over lines in a file
------------------------------

We will now use this file as input in a program that will do some data
processing. In the program, we will **read** each line of the file and
print it with some additional text. Because text files are sequences of
lines of text, we can use the *for* loop to iterate through each line of
the file.

A **line** of a file is defined to be a sequence of characters up to and
including a special character called the **newline** character. If you
evaluate a string that contains a newline character you will see the
character represented as ``\n``. If you print a string that contains a
newline you will not see the ``\n``, you will just see its effects. When
you are typing a Python program and you press the enter or return key on
your keyboard, the editor inserts a newline character into your text at
that point.

As the *for* loop iterates through each line of the file the loop
variable will contain the current line of the file as a string of
characters. The general pattern for processing each line of a text file
is as follows:

::

        for line in myFile:
            statement1
            statement2
            ...

To process all of our quarterback data, we will use a *for* loop to iterate over the lines of the file. Using
the ``split`` method, we can break each line into a list containing all the fields of interest about the
quarterback. We can then take the values corresponding to first name, lastname, and passer rating to
construct a simple sentence.


.. activecode:: files_for

    qbfile = open("qbdata.txt","r")

    for aline in qbfile:
        values = aline.split()
        print('QB ', values[0], values[1], 'had a rating of ', values[10] )

    qbfile.close()



Alternative File Reading Methods
--------------------------------

In addition to the ``for`` loop, Python provides three other methods to read data
from the input file. You don't really need to use all of them, but in case you encounter them, here's what they do.
The ``readline`` method reads one line from the file and
returns it as a string. The string returned by ``readline`` will contain the
newline character at the end. This method returns the empty string when it
reaches the end of the file. The ``readlines`` method returns the contents of
the entire file as a list of strings, where each item in the list represents
one line of the file. It is also possible to read the entire file into a
single string with ``read``. :ref:`Table 2 <filemethods2a>` summarizes these methods
and the following session shows them in action.

.. _filemethods2a:

======================== =========================== =====================================
**Method Name**           **Use**                     **Explanation**
======================== =========================== =====================================
``write``                 ``filevar.write(astring)``  Add astring to the end of the file.
                                                      filevar must refer to a file that has
                                                      been  opened for writing.
``read(n)``               ``filevar.read()``          Reads and returns a string of ``n``
                                                      characters, or the entire file as a
                                                      single string if  n is not provided.
``readline(n)``           ``filevar.readline()``      Returns the next line of the file with
                                                      all text up to and including the
                                                      newline character. If n is provided as
                                                      a parameter than only n characters
                                                      will be returned if the line is longer
                                                      than ``n``.
``readlines(n)``          ``filevar.readlines()``     Returns a list of strings, each
                                                      representing a single line of the file.
                                                      If n is not provided then all lines of
                                                      the file are returned. If n is provided
                                                      then n characters are read but n is
                                                      rounded up so that an entire line is
                                                      returned.
======================== =========================== =====================================


In this course, we will generally either iterate through the contents of a file using a for loop, or use read() to get all of the contents as a single string.

In other programming languages, where they don't have the convenient for loop method of going through the lines of the file one by one, they use a different pattern which requires a different kind of loop, 
the ``while`` loop. Fortunately, you don't need to learn this other pattern, and we will put off consideration of ``while`` loops indefinitely in this course.

.. note::

   A common error that novice programmers make is not realizing that all these ways of reading the file, including
   using the for loop to iterate over the lines, **use up the file**. 
   If you want to go through the contents twice, for now it is probably easiest to just
   open it twice, and iterate through it twice. If you cared about efficiency, you might 
   prefer to save the contents in a variable.


Writing Text Files
------------------

One of the most commonly performed data processing tasks is to read data from a file, manipulate it in some way, and then write the resulting data out to a new data file to be used for other purposes later.  
To accomplish this, the ``open`` function discussed above can also be used to create a new file prepared for writing.  
Note in :ref:`Table 1<filemethods1a>` above that the only difference between opening a file for writing and  opening a file for reading is the use of the ``'w'`` flag instead of the ``'r'`` flag as the second parameter.  
When we open a file for writing, a new, empty file with that name is created and made ready to accept our data. As before, the function returns a reference to the new file object.

:ref:`Table 2 <filemethods2a>` above shows one additional file method that we have not used thus far.  
The ``write`` method allows us to add data to a text file.  Recall that text files contain sequences of characters.  
We usually think of these character sequences as being the lines of the file where each line ends with the newline ``\n`` character.  
Be very careful to notice that the ``write`` method takes one parameter, a string.  When invoked, the characters of the string will be added to the end of the file.  
This means that it is the programmer's job to include the newline characters as part of the string if desired.

As an example, consider the ``qbdata.txt`` file once again.  Assume that we have been asked to provide a file consisting of only the names of the
quarterbacks.  In addition, the names should be in the order last name followed by first name with the names separated by a comma.  This
is a very common type of request, usually due to the fact that someone has a program that requires its data input format to be different from what is available.

To construct this file, we will approach the problem using a similar algorithm as above.  After opening the file, we will iterate thru the
lines, break each line into its parts, choose the parts that we need, and then output them.  Eventually, the output will be written to a file.

The program below solves part of the problem.  Notice that it reads the data and creates a string consisting of last name followed by a comma followed by the first name.  In this example, we simply print the lines as they are created.

.. activecode:: files_write01

    infile = open("qbdata.txt","r")
    # note: I have rewrittent the code to iterate using a for loop instead of a while loop; it's much simpler that way!
    # aline = infile.readline()
    # while aline:
    for aline in infile:
        items = aline.split()
        dataline = items[1] + ',' + items[0]
        print(dataline)
    #    aline = infile.readline()

    infile.close()

When we run this program, we see the lines of output on the screen.  Once we are satisfied that it is creating the appropriate output, the next step is to add the necessary pieces to produce an output file and write the data lines to it.  
To start, we need to open a new output file by adding another call to the ``open`` function, ``outfile = open("qbnames.txt",'w')``, using the ``'w'`` flag.  We can choose any file name we like.  
If the file does not exist, it will be created.  However, if the file does exist, it will be reinitialized as empty and you will lose any previous contents.  

Once the file has been created, we just need to call the ``write`` method passing the string that we wish to add to the file.  
In this case, the string is already being printed so we will just change the ``print`` into a call to the ``write`` method.  
However, there is one additional part of the data line that we need to include.  The newline character needs to be concatenated  to the end of the line.  
The entire line now becomes ``outfile.write(dataline + '\n')``.  The print statement automatically
outputs a newline character after whatever text it outputs, but the write method does not do that automatically. We also need to close the file when we are done.

The complete program is shown below.

.. note::
   Unfortunately, as described above, you can't actually write to a file when executing activecode in the browser. So for now, you'll just have to look at
   this program without being able to execute it.

.. sourcecode:: python

    infile = open("qbdata.txt","r")
    outfile = open("qbnames.txt","w")

    # note: I have rewrittent the code to iterate using a for loop instead of a while loop; it's much simpler that way!
    # aline = infile.readline()
    # while aline:
    for aline in infile:
        items = aline.split()
        dataline = items[1] + ',' + items[0]
        outfile.write(dataline + '\n')
    #    aline = infile.readline()

    infile.close()
    outfile.close()
    
    
The contents of the ``qbnames.txt`` file are as follows.
