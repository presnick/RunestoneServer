Printing in Python 2.7
======================

We have been a little sloppy with print statements, sometimes putting expressions in parentheses to make it look like print is a function call, but sometimes not. This was left ambiguous because printing is handled a little differently in the online environment than in a proper Python 2.7 interpreter.

Let's look a little more carefully at how print really works in Python 2.7, now that you can test things locally on your machine, with a full Pyton 2.7 interpreter. 

In fact, print is a special statement, not a function call. The general form of its syntax is ``print <expr> [, <expr>]*``. The square brackets indicates that it's optional to have additional expressions. The * means that you can have 0 or more of them. If <expr> evaluates to a single value, then the printed representation of that value is output. If there are several expressions, then the printed representation of each one is output, with spaces separating them. 

If there is just one expression and it is in parentheses, it has the same effect as not including the parentheses.

The online environment diverges slightly from a proper Python interpreter when it handles a statement like ``print (3, 5)``. In the online environment, that is treated the same as ``print 3, 5``, yielding an output of ``3 5``. In your native Python interpreter, ``print (3, 5)`` treats (3, 5) as a tuple, whose printed representation is ``(3, 5)``.

You can see the difference by comparing the outputs in Codelens and in an ActiveCode window. CodeLens uses a native Python interpreter, while ActiveCode is exececuted in the browser environment.

.. codelens:: interpolation_0

   print (3)
   print (3, 5)
   print 3, 5
   x = (3, 5)
   print x

.. activecode:: interpolation_0a

   print (3)
   print (3, 5)
   print 3, 5
   x = (3, 5)
   print x

From here on, when you run code in ActiveWindows, don't worry too much about whether the output looks like a tuple or not. The output that you get when you run it in a native python environment is what matters.

String Interpolation
====================

Until now, we have created strings with variable content using the + operator to concatenate partial strings together. That works, but it's very hard for people to read or debug a code line that includes variable names and strings and complex expressions. Consider the following: 

.. activecode:: interpolation_1

   name = "Rodney Dangerfield"
   score = -1  # No respect!
   print "Hello " + name + ". Your score is " + str(score)

Or perhaps more realistically:
 
.. activecode:: interpolation_2
 
   scores = [("Rodney Dangerfield", -1), ("Marlon Brando", 1), ("You", 100)]
   for (name, score) in scores:
      print "Hello " + name + ". Your score is " + str(score)

In this chapter, you will learn to write that in a more readable way:

.. activecode:: interpolation_3
 
   scores = [("Rodney Dangerfield", -1), ("Marlon Brando", 1), ("You", 100)]
   for (name, score) in scores:
      print "Hello %s. Your score is % d" % (name, score)
      
   # or some might find this even more readable
   for (name, score) in scores:
      print "Hello %(nm)s. Your score is %(sc) d" % {"nm":name, "sc":score}

``%`` is the interpolation operator. It takes a format string on the left, and values on the right. Together, the whole expression produces a single string. 

You now know enough python that you can start to learn directly from the python documentation. The python documentation on string interpolation is readable, with some effort, and a few explanations below. `String interpolation documentation <http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting-operations>`_   

* **Unicode** is a special kind of character string that allows the use of non-English characters

* What the documentation refers to as ``format`` is a string with some % signs embedded in it. These will be substituted for in the final string. When the documentation says "If *format* requires a single argument, it means there's just one % within the format string, indicating one element to be substituted for.

* The minimum field width and precision are useful for formatting numbers.

* The length modifier is not used, so don't worry about it.

Let's use the vocabulary of the documentation to parse the line of code ``"Hello %s. Your score is % 2d" % (name, score)``:

* The ``format string`` is "Hello %s. Your score is % d".

   * The first conversion specifier is ``%s``, which calls for a string value to be substituted.
   
   * The second conversion specifier is ``% d``, which calls for an integer. The space before the d is a flag, indicating that if the number is positive, it should generate a string without a + sign in it.
   
* The values are specified in the tuple ``(name, score)``. Note that neither name nor score are in quotes, so both are variables whose values are looked up. 

.. note::

   The ``%`` operator produces a string. It does not print anything, and it does not return anything. If you want a person to see the string, print it. If you want to save it for later, assign it to a variable or put it in a list. If you want a function to return the string, make an explicit return statement.

Try to predict what each of these lines will produce as you step through the code.

.. codelens:: interpolation_4

   x = 3.75
   print x
   print "You have $%0.2f in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%f in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%10.1f in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%0.0f in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%d in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%02d in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%0.2f. If you spend $1.25, you will have $%0.2f left" % (x, x-1.25)



Exercises
---------
  
1. Fill in the variables t and v so that it it prints out: ``You have $4.99 in your pocket``

.. actex:: interpolation_6

   pocketmoney = 4.99
   t =
   v =
   newstring = t % v
   print newstring
   
2. Fill in the variables t and v so that it it prints out: ``You have $5 in your pocket``

.. actex:: interpolation_7

   pocketmoney = 4.99
   t =
   v =
   newstring = t % v
   print newstring
   
3. Fill in the missing code after the vals = on the first line, so that it prints out: ``v1, v2 are the 2 items in the list``

.. actex:: interpolation_8

   vals =                            
   templ = "%s, %s are the %d items in the list"
   print templ % (vals[0], vals[1], len(vals))
