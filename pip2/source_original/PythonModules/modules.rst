A **module** is a file containing Python definitions and statements intended for
use in other Python programs. There are many Python modules that come with
Python as part of the **standard library**. 

The  `Python Documentation <http://docs.python.org/2/>`_ site for Python version
2.7 is an extremely useful reference for all aspects of Python. The site
contains a listing of all the standard modules that are available with Python
(see `Global Module Index <http://docs.python.org/2/py-modindex.html>`_). You
will also see that there is a
`Standard Library Reference <http://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html>`_
(Next week, there will be a chapter explaining how to read the language
reference documentation) and a
`Tutorial <http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html>`_, as well as
installation instructions, how-tos, and frequently asked questions.  We
encourage you to become familiar with this site and to use it often.

If you have not done so already, take a look at the Global Module Index.  Here
you will see an alphabetical listing of all the modules that are available as
part of the standard library.  Find the turtle module.


.. admonition:: Note: Python modules and limitations with activecode

	Throughout the chapters of this book, activecode windows allow you to practice the Python that you are learning.
	We mentioned in the first chapter that programming is normally done using some type of development
	environment and that the
	activecode used here was strictly to help us learn.  It is not the way we write production programs.

	To that end, it is necessary to mention that many of the  modules available in standard Python
	will **not** work in the activecode environment.  In fact, only turtle, math, random, and a couple others have been
	ported at this point.  If you wish to explore any
	additional modules, you will need to also explore using a more robust development environment.

The `math` module
-----------------

The ``math`` module contains the kinds of mathematical functions you would
typically find on your calculator and some mathematical constants like `pi` and
`e`.

The first thing we need to do when we wish to use a module is perform an
**import**. In this case, we write ``import math``. That creates a reference to
a module object that contains the elements of that module. This looks very much
like the reference diagrams we saw earlier for simple variables, but the module
object has a lot more stuff in it than the simple objects we've seen before,
too much stuff to show all of it in the reference diagram.

.. image:: Figures/mathmod.png

Here are some items from the math module in action.  If you want more
information, you can check out the
`Math Module <http://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html#module-math>`_ Python
Documentation.

.. activecode:: chmodule_02

    import math

    print(math.pi)
    print(math.e)

    print(math.sqrt(2.0))

    print(math.sin(math.radians(90)))   # sin of 90 degrees



..  Like almost all other programming languages, angles are expressed in *radians*
.. rather than degrees.  There are two functions ``radians`` and ``degrees`` to
.. convert between the two popular ways of measuring angles.

The math module contains a bunch of functions, like sqrt and sin, and a few
variables, like pi and e. Once we have imported the math module, anything
defined there can be used in our program.  The syntax to refer to things from
the math module is the name of the module followed by a `dot` followed by the
specific item from the module (e.g., ``math.sqrt``).  You can think of this as
lastname.firstname where the lastname is the module family and the firstname is
the individual entry in the module.

.. note::

    Previously, you have seen the `dot` notation used for invoking a method on an
    object, as in ``[1, 2, 3].append(4)``, which invokes the append method on the list [1, 2, 3], passing
    the parameter 4. This may seem a little confusing, especially when we
    invoke a function from the math library, as in `math.sqrt(2.0)`. Here, sqrt is
    not a method being applied to the math object. It's just a variable name being
    looked up in the math module. 
    
    After you learn about classes, there will be a unifying interpretation of the
    dot notation that will help you understand why the dot is used here for looking up 
    a variable or a function inside a module and also used for method invocation.
    For now, you'll have to keep them straight just by paying attention to whether
    the word before the dot refers to an imported module, or something else.

If you have not done so already, take a look at the documentation for the
`Math Module <http://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html#module-math>`_.

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: question4_2_1
   :answer_a: import math
   :answer_b: include math
   :answer_c: use math
   :answer_d:  You donâ€™t need a statement.  You can always use the math module
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The module must be imported before you can use anything declared inside the module.
   :feedback_b: The correct term is not include, but you are close.
   :feedback_c: You will be using parts of the module, but that is not the right term.
   :feedback_d: You cannot use a Python module without a statement at the top of your program that explicitly tells Python you want to use the module.

   Which statement allows you to use the math module in your program?

.. mchoicema:: questions4_2_1a
    :answer_a: "math.pi".split('.')
    :answer_b: math.pi
    :answer_c: math.sqrt(2.0)
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: math.pi is in quotes, so it's just a literal string. The split method is called on it. The return value is ["math", "pi"]
    :feedback_b: math.pi looks up pi within the math module. It is not a method invocation.
    :feedback_c: This looks up sqrt in the math module. It's a function, and that function is invoked, passing the value 2.0   
     
    Which of the following is a method invocation, in code followign the statement ``import math`` has been run?

The `random` module
-------------------

We often want to use **random numbers** in programs.  Here are a few typical
uses:

* To play a game of chance where the computer needs to throw some dice, pick a
  number, or flip a coin,
* To shuffle a deck of playing cards randomly,
* To randomly allow a new enemy spaceship to appear and shoot at you,
* To simulate possible rainfall when we make a computerized model for
  estimating the environmental impact of building a dam,
* For encrypting your banking session on the Internet.

Python provides a module ``random`` that helps with tasks like this.  You can
take a look at it in the documentation.  Here are the key things we can do with
it.

.. activecode:: chmodule_rand

    import random

    prob = random.random()
    print(prob)

    diceThrow = random.randrange(1,7)       # return an int, one of 1,2,3,4,5,6
    print(diceThrow)

Press the run button a number of times.  Note that the values change each time.
These are random numbers.

The ``randrange`` function generates an integer between its lower and upper
argument, using the same semantics as ``range`` --- so the lower bound is
included, but the upper bound is excluded.   All the values have an equal
probability of occurring (i.e. the results are *uniformly* distributed).

The ``random()`` function returns a floating point number in the range [0.0,
1.0) --- the square bracket means "closed interval on the left" and the round
parenthesis means "open interval on the right".  In other words, 0.0 is
possible, but all returned numbers will be strictly less than 1.0.  It is usual
to *scale* the results after calling this method, to get them into a range
suitable for your application.

In the case shown below, we've converted the result of the method call to a
number in the range [0.0, 5.0).  Once more, these are uniformly distributed
numbers --- numbers close to 0 are just as likely to occur as numbers close to
3, or numbers close to 5. If you continue to press the run button you will see
random values between 0.0 and up to but not including 5.0.

.. activecode:: chmodule_rand2

    import random

    prob = random.random()
    result = prob * 5
    print(result)




.. index:: deterministic algorithm,  algorithm; deterministic, unit tests

It is important to note that random number generators are based on a
**deterministic** algorithm --- repeatable and predictable. So they're called
**pseudo-random** generators --- they are not genuinely random. They start with
a *seed* value. Each time you ask for another random number, you'll get one
based on the current seed attribute, and the state of the seed (which is one of
the attributes of the generator) will be updated.  The good news is that each
time you run your program, the seed value is likely to be different meaning
that even though the random numbers are being created algorithmically, you will
likely get random behavior each time you execute.



**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: question4_4_1
   :answer_a: math.pi
   :answer_b: math(pi)
   :answer_c: pi.math
   :answer_d: math->pi
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: To invoke or reference something contained in a module you use the dot (.) notation.
   :feedback_b: This is the syntax for calling a function, not referencing an item in a module.
   :feedback_c: The module name must come first when accessing values and functions with a module.
   :feedback_d: The -> notation is not used in Python.

   Which of the following is the correct way to reference the value pi within the math module.   Assume you have already imported the math module.

.. mchoicemf:: question4_4_2
   :answer_a: the math module
   :answer_b: the random module
   :answer_c: the turtle module
   :answer_d: the game module
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: While you might want to use the math module for other numerical computations in your program, it does not contain functions that are likely to help you simulate a dice roll.
   :feedback_b: You would likely call the function random.randrange.
   :feedback_c: The turtle module, while producing interesting graphics, is unlikely to help you here.
   :feedback_d: Python does not have a game module.

   Which module would you most likely use if you were writing a function to simulate rolling dice?


.. mchoicemf:: question4_4_3
   :answer_a: prob = random.randrange(1, 101)
   :answer_b: prob = random.randrange(1, 100)
   :answer_c: prob = random.randrange(0, 101)
   :answer_d: prob = random.randrange(0, 100)
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: This will generate a number between 1 and 101, but does not include 101.
   :feedback_b: This will generate a number between 1 and 100, but does not include 100.  The highest value generated will be 99.
   :feedback_c: This will generate a number between 0 and 100.  The lowest value generated is 0.  The highest value generated will be 100.
   :feedback_d: This will generate a number between 0 and 100, but does not include 100.  The lowest value generated is 0 and the highest value generated will be 99.

   The correct code to generate a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) is:

.. mchoicemf:: question4_4_4
   :answer_a: There is no computer on the stage for the drawing.
   :answer_b: Because computers donâ€™t really generate random numbers, they generate pseudo-random numbers.
   :answer_c: They would just generate the same numbers over and over again.
   :answer_d: The computer canâ€™t tell what values were already selected, so it might generate all 5â€™s instead of 5 unique numbers.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: They could easily put one there.
   :feedback_b: Computers generate random numbers using a deterministic algorithm.  This means that if anyone ever found out the algorithm they could accurately predict the next value to be generated and would always win the lottery.
   :feedback_c: This might happen if the same seed value was used over and over again, but they could make sure this was not the case.
   :feedback_d: While a programmer would need to ensure the computer did not select the same number more than once, it is easy to ensure this.

   One reason that lotteries donâ€™t use computers to generate random numbers is:

        .. tab:: Question

           The **Pythagorean Theorem** tells us that the length of
           the hypotenuse of a right triangle is related to the lengths of the
           other two sides.  Look thru the ``math`` module and see if you can
           find a function that will compute this relationship for you.  Once
           you find it, write a short program to try it out. Of course, you
           could also write your function to compute it, but the goal here
           is to learn to look through the module documentation and use the
           functions that are provided.
