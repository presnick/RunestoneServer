   * Before Tuesday's class:      
      * :ref:`Installation <installation_chap>`
   
   * Before Thursday's class:
      * :ref:`Keyword-based parameter passing <keyword_pararams_chap>`
      * :ref:`Printing and parentheses <print_tuples>`
      * :ref:`String interpolation <interpolation_chap>`

#. Turn in the reading response, by 8 PM the night before your registered section meets.

   * Read *The Success of Open Source*, Chapter 1
   * :ref:`Reading response 7 <response_7>`

#. Do Problem Set 7:

   * :ref:`Problem Set 7  <problem_set_7>`

Reading Response 7
------------------

Briefly define open source software in your own words.

   """

Weber argues that you should be surprised that there is high quality open source software out there and offers some questions/puzzles that he thinks need to be answered in ordered to explain how that has happened. Which of those questions do *you* think really are puzzling, and which, if any, do you think have obvious answers? 

.. actex:: rr_7_2

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes
   s = """

   """

Was there anything from this chapter you found confusing? If so, what?

Problem Set 7
-------------

All of the problem set instructions for this week are in the code file ps7/ps7.py.

At your terminal window, cd to your code directory, then enter the following comands:

* ``git status`` If your working directory is not "clean", make sure to save and commit all your work. 

* ``git pull upstream master`` to get the latest code from us.

* ``cd ps7``. That will connect you to the subdirectory ps7

* ``ls``. You should see ps7.py, test.py, train.txt, and test.txt

* In your text editor, edit ps7.py, which contains instructions on what changes you are supposed to make. In your command prompt, run the code file by typing ``python ps7.py``

* Don't forget to finish the workflow by committing your work and pushing it to bitbucket. See :ref:`Git workflow <git_workflow>`
