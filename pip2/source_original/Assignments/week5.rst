In the next few questions, you'll build components and then a complete program
that lets people play Hangman. Below is an image from the middle of a game.

         #this should produce the output
         #health: ----

     
5. (2 points) Cut and paste your two function definitions at the top of this code. Then replace the line with a comment that says to invoke the function game_state_prompt. Run the code to play the game with a friend! Feel free to change max_health if you want to make the game easier or harder to win. For fun, feel free to replace your output_health function with something that produces cool ASCII art of a hangman. (Try Googling "Hangman ASCII art".)
