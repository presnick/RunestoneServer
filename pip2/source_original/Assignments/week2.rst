Problem Set
-----------
**Due:** **Friday, January 17, 5 pm**

**Instructions:** Write the code you want to save in the provided boxes, and click **save** for each one. The last code you have saved for each one by the deadline is what will be graded.

1. (1 pt) Given the following code, write a print statement that will pick out the letter ``"o"``, from the string ``s``. 

   .. actex:: ps_1_1

       s = "Hello, all"
      
      

#. (1 pt) Write code to print this string WITHOUT any ``&`` signs.

      This is a really fun&& homework assign&ment. And & I love&& &&Python.

   .. actex:: ps_1_2
   
         # Here's the string provided for you
         nst = "This is a really fun&& homework assign&ment. And & I love&& &&Python."
      
      # Write your code to print this string without any "&s", below:
      

#. (1 pt) What is the index of the first letter "h" in this sentence? Write code to find it, and print it. (Remember, an index is the __th element of a string or a list, for example.)

      This is a really fun homework assigment, and I love Python.

   .. actex:: ps_1_3
   
         # Here's the sentence, provided for you
         st = "This is a really fun homework assigment, and I love Python."
      
      ## Write your code to find the first index of the letter "h" below:
   

#. (3 pts) See comments for instructions.

   .. actex:: ps_1_4
      
      abc = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
      
      # What is the type of value is in the variable abc? 
      # Write code to find out what type the value of abc is.
      
      ## Write the type here: _______
      
      # write code to extract and print the first three elements of abc
      
      # write code to extract and print the last element of abc
      
      # write code to extract and print the number 4 from abc
      
      # write code to extract and print the number 6 from abc
      
      # write code to find out what type the first element of abc is, and print it.



#. (2 pts) See the comments for instructions.

   .. actex:: ps_1_5
   
      xy_lst = ["hello","goodbye","welcome","106","si 106"]
      abc_sentence = "Welcome to SI 106, everyone."
      
      # write code to extract and print the first element of xy_lst
      
      # write code to extract and print the last element of xy_lst
      
      # write code to extract and print the first character of abc_sentence
      
      # write code to extract and print the last character of abc_sentence

         
#. (2 pts) Write code to ask the user for their name and print out ``"Nice to meet you, <THEIR NAME>"``

   .. actex:: ps_1_6
   
      # For example, if you enter "Nick", your code should then print "Nice to meet you, Nick" abc
            print abc[:3]
            ## other possibilities include:
            # print a[0], a[1], a[2]
            
            # write code to extract and print the last element of abc
            print abc[-1]
            
            # write code to extract and print the number 4 from abc
            print abc[3]
            
            # write code to extract and print the number 6 from abc
            print abc[5]
            
            # write code to find out what type the first element of abc is, and print it.
            print type(abc[0])
