Problem Set 5
-------------

This problem set builds from the previous problem set's solution. You will write
code that makes the next guess in a hangman game, instead of having a person do it.

A version of the **guess** function is provided. It picks a random letter from the alphabet and guesses it if (even if it was guessed previously!) But with more information, we can change the function to make a better guess that is more likely to be in the word.

You will have to write a new function, **better_guess**. The problem set will walk you through making a series of improvements to the
guess function. 

First, take a look at the game function that is provided.

Note that when game is called, no parameter values are provided, and so the default
values are used. With the parameter **manual** set to (assigned the value) True, lots of feedback is given and the user has to click OK to initiate each guess. 

But without the argument **manual** being set to (assigned the value) True, the game runs till it is completed, and only two things are returned: the number of guesses used and the minimum number of guesses that could have been used.

With the argument **better** set to False, the **guess** function, which is already defined in the provided code, is called. If the argument **better** is set to True, a different function (that you will define in a later exercise) will get called instead.

Try passing some different parameter values in the invocation of the function **game**, in order to see how it works. Remember, a function invocation is the same as a function call. (Remember the last problem in Problem Set 4 and all the examples from the textbook?)

In the code windows below, there is a big chunk of code that is provided to you that you should **not change**, except perhaps to add some print statements temporarily to figure out what it's doing. 

1. (1 point) Change the invocation of the function game at the bottom of the code below, so that the maximum number of wrong guesses is 3.

                game(True, False, 3) # run with False so it's not manual
                # and the third parameter is 3 so the game is played with a max of 3 wrong guesses (max health is 3, when it's gone, no more guesses!)

2. (2 points) Compute the average performance over many plays of the game.

Instead of playing the game once, you can get a better sense of the guesser's 
average performance by having it play the game many times. Write code to
run the game many times. Add up the total number of guesses it makes, and the
minimum number of guesses it could have made. Print out the ratio. The closer to 1,
the better your guesser.

(Hint: you will go crazy clicking OK forever unless you set the manual parameter to False in your
calls to the function game.)

3. (1 point) Compute letter frequencies.

Now let's start building a better guesser. The initiall guess function selects
a random letter, without looking at all at blanked or its previous guesses. One obvious 
thing to do is to guess letters that occur more frequently. 

For this exercise, you will take the first step toward that. Here your job is to define a function
letter_frequencies. It takes a list of strings (words) as an input. As an output
it produces a dictionary with a key for each letter that appears in any of the
words. The value associated with each letter is the count of how many times the
letter appears in any of the words.

We have included some hidden code that runs unit tests on your function. If your
function is not producing the right outputs, it will give you some diagnostic
messages.

5. (3 points) Make a better version of possible words

Once you have made some guesses, not all of the words are still possible. For starters,
words that are longer or shorter than the blanked word are not possible.
Second, if you have guessed a letter that it's in the word, then only 
words containing that letter are still possible (actually, only words that have
that letter in the right place). Finally, if you have guessed a letter that's not
in the word, then only words that don't contain that letter are still possible.
Revise the possible_words function so that it returns a shorter list of possible
words (without removing any that are still possible.)

There are some hidden test cases that will give you feedback on how well you're doing.
If you don't manage to get exactly the number we got, you can still go on and 
let the graders figure it out, but most likely you've got an error.

Define a function filtered_count that takes a list as its first parameter and
a function as its second parameter. The function passed as the second value should be a boolean function that
takes a single parameter and returns True or False.

            def filtered_count(L, f):
                
                count = 0
                
                for x in L:
                    if f(x):
                        count = count + 1 
                
                return count


            print(filtered_count([4, 2, 0, 5, 6, 5], lambda x: x > 3))
            # Should return 4, the count of items in the list that are bigger than 3

Thursday In-class Exercises
---------------------------

If you had trouble with the exercise at the bottom of the sorting chapter, I've broken
it up into several steps here. 

Step 1. Suppose you had this list, [8, 7, 6, 6, 4, 4, 3, 1, 0], already sorted, how would you make a list of just the best 5? (Hint: take a slice).

             L[:5]
            

Now suppose the list wasn't sorted yet. How would get those same five elements from this list?

            L = [0, 1, 6, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 4]
            L2 = sorted(L, None, None, True)
            L2[:5]
    
        
    
Now make a dictionary of counts for how often these numbers appear in the lists.

            L = [0, 1, 6, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 1, 6, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 35, 4, 11]
            d = {}
            for x in L:
                if x in d:
                    d[x] = d[x] + 1
                else:
                    d[x] = 1
            
            
Now sort the (number, count) pairs and keep just the top five pairs. Review
:ref:`Sorting a Dictionary <sort_dictionaries>` if you're not sure how to do this.

            d = {}
            for x in L:
                if x in d:
                    d[x] = d[x] + 1
                else:
                    d[x] = 1

            s = sorted(d.items(), None, lambda x: x[1], True)
            
            print(s[:5])
            

Finally, generalize what you've done. Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns a list of the five
most frequent characters in the string. If you're amibitious write a few test cases for it, using import test and then test.testEqual.

Functions Review
----------------

These are review problems that we worked on and discussed in section this week. Each problem asks you to define a function, specifies the input that the function takes, and what the function should do.

The problems AND the solutions are provided for you, since you worked on them in class. (Problems and questions you addressed in discussion may vary slightly by section!) We suggest that you try to do the problems again yourself before looking at the solutions (which are heavily commented to address questions that came up in the discussion group work).

1. Define (and call) a function called `` get_vowels `` which takes an **input** of a string and **returns the total number of vowels in the string**.

    .. tabbed:: func_review_1

        .. tab:: Problem

            .. actex:: fr_1

                # Write your code here!


                # Here's a sample function call.
                print get_vowels("Hello all") # This should print: 3

        .. tab:: Solution

            .. actex:: fr_1a

                def get_vowels(s):
                    vowels = "aeiou"
                    total = 0
                    for v in vowels:
                        total += s.count(v)
                    return total

                print get_vowels("Hello all")

#. Define (and call) a function called `` sum_a_list `` which **takes any list of integers** and **returns the sum of all integers in the list**.

    .. tabbed:: func_review_2

        .. tab:: Problem

            .. actex:: fr_2

                # Here's a sample function call.
                print sum_a_list([1,4,7,5]) # this should print: 17

                # Extra practice: 
                # how would you change this function just a LITTLE 
                # so that the function could also take a string of digits
                # and return the sum of all those digits.
                # (Hint: to do this, you only have to type 5 more characters.)

                    tot = 0
                    for i in lt:
                        tot = tot + i
                    return tot

                print sum_a_list(1,4,7,5])

                # Here's the version of the function that will work
                #   for EITHER a list of integers or a string of digits
                def sum_a_list_or_digitstring(lt):
                    tot = 0
                    for i in lt:
                        tot = tot + int(i)
                    return tot

                print sum_a_list_or_digitstring("1475")


#. Define (and call!) a function called ``common_word`` that **takes a string** and **prints a tuple** of **the most commonly used word in the string** and **the number of times that word is used**. (If there's more than one word that's used most frequently, the function should **print** all of those words.)

                # For extra practice: you've done something like this before --

                            d[w] = 1
                    kys = d.keys() # get all the keys from the dict you built, in a list
                    most_common = kys[0] # start at the beginning of the list -- this is the most common so far!
                    for k in d: # go through the keys in the dictionary
                        if d[k] > d[most_common]: # if the value of the key is bigger than the value of the most common key SO FAR, then you have a new most common key so far
                            most_common = k # so reassign the most_common key
                    for ky in d: # now that we know the value of the most common key, go through the keys of the dictionary again
                        if d[ky] == d[most_common]: # for every key that has the same value as the most common one
                            print ky, d[ky] # print the key and its value
                            # note that we do NOT return anything here!
                            # because we asked to print stuff out

                # Think further: what would happen if you put a return statement where that print statement is? why wouldn't that work?


#. Define (and call!) a function called ``smallest_value_name`` that **takes a dictionary** with key-value pairs of names and integer values, like this: ``{"Nick": 56, "Paul":73, "Jackie":42}``, and **returns the name associated with the *lowest integer value**. (So in the case of that example dictionary, the function should return ``Jackie``.)
