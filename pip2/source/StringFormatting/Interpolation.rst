String Interpolation
====================

Until now, we have created strings with variable content using the + operator to concatenate partial strings together. That works, but it's very hard for people to read or debug any code line that includes variable names and strings and complex expressions. Consider the following: 

.. activecode:: interpolation_1

   name = "Rodney Dangerfield"
   score = -1  # No respect!
   print "Hello " + name + ". Your score is " + str(score)

Or perhaps more realistically:
 
.. activecode:: interpolation_2
 
   scores = [("Rodney Dangerfield", -1), ("Marlon Brando", 1), ("You", 100)]
   for (name, score) in scores:
      print "Hello " + name + ". Your score is " + str(score)

In this section, you will learn to write that in a more readable way:

.. activecode:: interpolation_3
 
   scores = [("Rodney Dangerfield", -1), ("Marlon Brando", 1), ("You", 100)]
   for (name, score) in scores:
      print "Hello %s. Your score is % d" % (name, score)
      
   # or some might find this even more readable
   for (name, score) in scores:
      print "Hello %(nm)s. Your score is %(sc) d" % {"nm":name, "sc":score}

``%`` is the interpolation operator. It takes a format string on the left, and a tuple of values on the right. Together, the whole expression produces a single string. 

You now know enough python that you can start to learn directly from the python documentation. The python documentation on string interpolation is readable, with some effort, and a few explanations below. `String interpolation documentation <http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting-operations>`_   

* **Unicode** is a special kind of character string that allows the use of non-English characters

* What the documentation refers to as ``format`` is a string with some % signs embedded in it. These will be substituted for in the final string. When the documentation says "If *format* requires a single argument, it means there's just one % within the format string, indicating one element to be substituted for.

* The minimum field width and precision are useful for formatting numbers.

* The length modifier is not used, so don't worry about it.

Let's use the vocabulary of the documentation to parse the line of code ``"Hello %s. Your score is % 2d" % (name, score)``:

* The ``format string`` is "Hello %s. Your score is % d".

   * The first conversion specifier is ``%s``, which calls for a string value to be substituted.
   
   * The second conversion specifier is ``% d``, which calls for an integer. The space before the d is a flag, indicating that if the number is positive, it should generate a string without a + sign in it.
   
* The values are specified in the tuple ``(name, score)``. Note that neither name nor score are in quotes, so both are variables whose values are looked up. 

.. note::

   The ``%`` operator produces a string. It does not print anything, and it does not return anything. If you want a person to see the string, print it. If you want to save it for later, assign it to a variable or put it in a list. If you want a function to return the string, make an explicit return statement.

Try to predict what each of these lines will produce as you step through the code.

.. codelens:: interpolation_4

   x = 3.75
   print x
   print "You have $%0.2f in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%f in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%10.1f in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%0.0f in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%d in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%02d in your pocket" % (x)
   print "You have $%0.2f. If you spend $1.25, you will have $%0.2f left" % (x, x-1.25)
